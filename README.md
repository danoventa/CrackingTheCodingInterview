Note: There will be :bug:s and quirks. Please come tell us about them!

nteract is a literate coding environment that supports Python, R, JavaScript and [other Jupyter kernels](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPython-kernels-for-other-languages). It wraps up the best of the web based Jupyter notebook and embeds it as a desktop application that allows you to open notebooks natively on your system. Double click a `.ipynb` on the desktop, use Spotlight on the Mac. It Just Works™

### Scope and goals

* Notebook environment to explore and get things done ✅
* Standalone cross-platform desktop application ✅
* One notebook document/narrative per window ✅
* Work with any Jupyter kernel using message spec v5 ✅
* Easy install with pre-configured Python3 and JavaScript runtimes ❌
* Grow an ecosystem of tooling to allow others to build their own platforms relying on the Jupyter specifications 🔜

### Development

To get started developing install a [python runtime](#python-runtime) then install [`nteract` in dev mode](#install-nteract-in-dev-mode).

#### Python runtime

At least for now, we need the python 3 kernel installed when hacking on nteract:

```
python3 -m pip install ipykernel
python3 -m ipykernel install --user
```

#### Install `nteract` in dev mode

Requires [node 6.x and npm 3](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).

**Prerequisites for Linux**
- `python` (`v2.7` recommended, `v3.x.x` is not supported)
- `make`
- A proper C/C++ compiler toolchain, like [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)

Use your distribution's package manager to install.

**Prerequisites for macOS**

- `python` (`v2.7` recommended, `v3.x.x` is not supported): already installed on Mac OS X
- `Xcode Command Line Tools`: Can be installed with `xcode-select --install`

**Prerequisites for Windows**

- **Option 1:** Install all the required tools and configurations using Microsoft's [windows-build-tools](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools) by running `npm install -g windows-build-tools` from an elevated PowerShell (run as Administrator).
- **Option 2:** Install dependencies and configuration manually
   1. Visual C++ Build Environment:
     * **Option 1:** Install [Visual C++ Build Tools](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691126) using the *Default Install* option.
     * **Option 2:** Install [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs) (or modify an existing installation) and select *Common Tools for Visual C++* during setup.  

  > :bulb: [Windows Vista / 7 only] requires [.NET Framework 4.5.1](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40773)

  2. Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or [Miniconda 2.7](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) (`v3.x.x` is not supported), and run `npm config set python python2.7`
  3. Launch cmd, `npm config set msvs_version 2015`

##### Now you're ready to build!

1. Fork this repo
2. Clone it `git clone https://github.com/nteract/nteract`
3. `cd` to where you `clone`d it
4. `npm install`
5. `npm run start`

As you make changes, close the entire app (cmd-q on OS X, or ctrl-c at the terminal) then run `npm run start` again.

#### Build Documentation
You can run nteract's documentation generator by running

```
npm run build:docs
```

And then opening `docs/index.html` in your favorite browser.

#### Troubleshooting

> I upgraded my developer installation and things are broken!

- Try `npm run reinstall`

## For maintainers: Creating a release

### Bump the version

```
cd app
npm version {major|minor|patch}
cd ..
git push
git push --tags
```

### Create the package

It is recommended to run `npm run reinstall` before packaging a release.

To package a release run:
```
npm run dist
```

This needs to be done on every platform we like to ship.

The OS X release has to be signed with an Apple developer key. Currently only
Kyle (@rgbkrk) has this set up.

Then verify that the copy of nteract in `dist/` works
properly (mostly ad-hoc basic notebook loading and execution).
